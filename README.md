## Goals of Fellowship Project

Broadly, the aims of this project can be split into four categories, comprising what we refer to as the '**SAFE**' framework:

{% tab title="Simplify" %}
**Make real-time sea-level-rise data tools easy to understand, simple to use and engaging for everyday residents.**

1. _Make SLR visual._ ****Too often, researchers present dense statistical data graphics to depict SLR that are generated using analytics software such as R or Python. While the analysis process is highly accurate and replicable, the output isn't tailored for real people.
2. Make SLR relatable.
3. Make SLR highly local.
